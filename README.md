# AWS & DevOps Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Atharva Kishor Matale — a final year IT student, currently on a deep learning journey into the world of Cloud Computing and DevOps.

For the past 9 weeks (and ongoing), I’ve been consistently learning and applying core concepts of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and DevOps tools & practices. I'm documenting this journey week-by-week, covering both theory and hands-on practice.

This repository serves as my public portfolio — a place to showcase my learning, progress, and dedication towards becoming a skilled DevOps/Cloud Engineer.
